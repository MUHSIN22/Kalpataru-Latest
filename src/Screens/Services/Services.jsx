                    The Government of India established the National Pension System (NPS) 
                    so that all participants would receive a steady stream of money once they 
                    reached retirement age. The PFRDA (Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority) 
                    oversees NPS.Â It allows you to invest in the scheme throughout your employment.

                    It was introduced by the government in 
                    2004. Initially, it was an exclusive scheme 
                    available only to government employees. 
                    However, in 2009, NPS in India was made 
                    available to employees beyond the public 
                    sector. It allows you to invest in the 
                    scheme throughout your employment.

            <p>
              Investing in a bond is similar to lending money to a firm or the government. 
              The loan is used by the company for operating expenses, and the investor earns interest. 
              A bond's market value might fluctuate over time.

          <p>
          Investing in bond funds is a sensible alternative to only buying equities for 
          portfolio diversification. Bonds are safer investment options than stock markets or mutual funds.
