            A PAN card is an essential document for any Indian citizen for proof
            of identity and more importantly for all your tax purposes. The
            Income Tax Department of India has made PAN card applications easier
            over the years with the help of the internet.

            Application of a PAN card can be done online as well as through
            offline methods. To apply for the card online, you can visit the
            official website of Protean eGov Technologies Limited (formerly
            NSDL) and fill in the required details. You can also visit the
            website of UTIIISL to do so. For offline application, you will be
            required to download the application form and submit it to the
            agency of your choice.
